on engineer port repair ship crew units. It covers their mission,
organization, equipment, training, and operations. It stresses the use
of the ships and describes their equipment.</h3>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="para_2"><span class="paraheading">2. MISSION.</span>
<b>a.</b> Engineer port repair ship crews are military units organized
to assist in the opening and rehabilitation of captured ports. They
operate from engineer port repair ships which are ocean-going steam
or Diesel-powered vessels. (See fig. <a href="#fig_1">1</a> and sec. <a href="#SECTION_III">III</a> for the ships’
specifications.)</h3>

<p><b>b.</b> In performing this mission, a port repair ship crew might
be required to assist in removing obstructions and debris from harbor
entrances, harbors, docks, and areas alongside wharves, quays, and
piers; repair underwater structures; make and repair parts for damaged
port facilities and equipment; and salvage cargos and small craft.
Large salvage operations are a naval function and are handled by the
Navy’s salvage ships.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="para_3"><span class="paraheading">3. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER UNITS.</span>
<b>a. Port construction and repair groups.</b> The engineer port repair
ship operates as the offshore arm of the port construction and repair
group (FM 5-5) and is under the group commander’s authority.</h3>

<p>(1) The group’s mission is to return captured ports to operating
condition. It repairs such port facilities as power and water-supply
plants, communications, wharves, docks, warehouses, and cargo-handling
equipment. (See fig. <a href="#fig_2">2</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Usually, the engineer port repair ship is the first large vessel
to enter the port; it carries in supplies and equipment to help the
port group start its work. Some of this equipment such as portable
generators, pneumatic drills, paving breakers, hammers, and saws, may
be put ashore and used by the group’s personnel. In addition, the
facilities of the various shops on the ship are used for making or
repairing parts for damaged port machinery and equipment.</p>

<p><b>b. Transportation Corps.</b> After the harbor has been cleared,
the engineer port repair ship may be called on to assist harbor craft
units of the Transportation Corps in heavy towing or cargo-handling
operations.</p>

<p><b>c. Navy.</b> Naval minesweepers precede the engineer port repair
ship into the harbor, clear the harbor of mines, and report dangerous
areas to the engineer port repair ship.</p>

<br />
<span class="large">ORGANIZATION AND DUTIES OF PERSONNEL</span></h2></div>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="para_4"><span class="paraheading">4. ORGANIZATION.</span> The engineer port repair ship crew is
composed of specialists. The classifications include master mechanic,
electrician, boatswain, diver, radio operator, Diesel mechanic,
welder, blacksmith, cook, and able-bodied seaman. The crew consists of
commissioned officers, warrant officers, and enlisted men. (See fig. <a href="#fig_3">3</a>.)</h3>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="para_5"><span class="paraheading">5. DUTIES OF PERSONNEL.</span>
<b>a. General.</b> Members of the crew are assigned to one of four
sections: deck, engine, operating, or headquarters. However, all
personnel must be trained to assist in performing tasks besides those
specifically assigned. For instance, additional deckhands may be
needed in bad weather or in making fast to a wharf, or extra riggers
may be required to move heavy materials or load or unload equipment or
supplies.</h3>

<p><b>b. Ship’s master.</b> The ship’s master is responsible for
everything done by his ship and crew. He must be a technical specialist
as well as a military leader. His principal responsibilities are:</p>

<p>(1) Safe navigation and efficient handling of his ship at all times.</p>

<p>(2) Direction of operations in carrying out the ship’s mission.</p>

<p>(3) The condition and appearance of his ship.</p>

<p>(4) Administrative duties and the discipline and morale of his crew.</p>

<p><b>c. Deck section.</b> Crew members of the deck section are primarily
responsible for:</p>

<p>(1) Sea-detail duties specified by the deck officer.</p>

<p>(2) Outward appearance of the ship. This includes painting, rust
prevention, and general ship-shape condition.</p>

<p>(3) Handling lines in mooring and docking.</p>

<p>(4) Navigation of the ship.</p>

<p>(5) Weighing or dropping anchor.</p>

<p><b>d. Engine section.</b> The engine section operates, maintains, and
repairs the ship’s main and auxiliary engines, compressors, pumps,
generators, motors, and electrical systems.</p>

<p><b>e. Operating section.</b> The personnel of the operating section are
under the supervision of the salvage officer and are responsible for:</p>

<p>(1) All diving operations, including underwater inspections,
construction, repairs, and demolitions.</p>

<p>(2) Operation and maintenance of machine, welding, blacksmith, pipe,
and carpenter shops.</p>

<p>(3) Clearing harbor areas of debris and obstructions and restoring
navigational aids.</p>

<p><b>f. Headquarters section.</b> This section is responsible for general
administrative, housekeeping, and radio-communication duties aboard
ship. These duties include operation and supply of the ship’s galley
and cold-storage compartments, and supply and storage of all food,
silverware, clothing, and linens.</p>

<p><b>g. Attached armed guard.</b> A Navy gun crew operates and maintains
the ship’s antiaircraft (AA) armament. (See par <a href="#para_7e">7e</a>.) Each member of the
gun crew takes his turn at standing watch.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="para_6"><span class="paraheading">6. SHIP MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.</span> The ship’s crew is responsible
for maintenance of the vessel, its engines, and all machinery, within
the limits of the vessel’s tools and spare parts and the ability of the
crew. Higher echelons of maintenance, including routine overhauls, are
requested through higher authority. As a guide to maintenance required
of the ship’s crew, all personnel will familiarize themselves with
chapter 4, “Keeping Shipshape,” FM 55-130.</h3>

<b>a. General external characteristics.</b> An engineer port repair
ship is similar in external appearance to the average sea-going
commercial cargo carrier. Two ready means of identification are the
cathead on the ship’s prow and the number and arrangement of the cargo
booms. These features are discussed in detail in paragraph <a href="#para_10">10</a>. (See
figs. <a href="#fig_4">4</a> and <a href="#fig_5">5</a>.) The ship’s superstructure begins at the mainmast and
continues aft to the stern. Forward of the superstructure are the two
masts, the three hatches, and the forecastle deck.</h3>

<p><b>c. Displacement.</b></p>

<p>(1) The dead-weight scale (fig. <a href="#fig_10">10</a>), shows the ship’s capacity
for carrying dead weight, the difference between light and loaded
displacement.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 10 also shows the ship’s load-line marks<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and their
relation to the decks. These marks establish the safe load line for the
ship in different waters, allowing a measure of reserve buoyancy. Load
lines are established and assigned by the American Bureau of Shipping.
The center of the circle is located exactly amidships on the vessel’s
load waterline, and the horizontal line through the circle corresponds
to the summer load line. The letters <i>AB</i>, used where the horizontal
line cuts the circle, indicate the American Bureau of Shipping. The
letter <i>F</i> to the left of the vertical line is the fresh-water marking,
and <i>S</i> to the right of the vertical line is the salt-water marking.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="para_8"><span class="paraheading">8. EQUIPMENT FOR SHIP OPERATION.</span>
<b>a. General.</b> This paragraph describes briefly the major items of
equipment required for the operation of the ship.</h3>

<p><b>b. Navigation equipment.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Compasses.</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The ship is equipped with magnetic and gyrocompasses. The master
gyrocompass is located below decks in the gyro-room. The readings
of this compass are transmitted to repeaters, which are similar in
appearance to magnetic compasses and are placed in the pilot house and
at other points where knowledge of the ship’s heading is required.
Gyrocompass equipment includes the master compass and its supports,
batteries, a motor-generator set for supplying power in case of failure
of the ship’s supply, instrument panel, and a panel for fuses and
switches for the repeaters.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The magnetic compass is in the pilot house. It is mounted in
a compensating binnacle that neutralizes or compensates for errors
introduced into the compass by the magnetic materials on the ship. (See
figs. <a href="#fig_8">8</a> and <a href="#fig_9">9</a>.)</p>

<p>(2) <i>Pelorus.</i> A pelorus is mounted on each wing of the navigating
bridge. The pelorus is a graduated circle mounted in gimbals with an
alidade pivoted over its center. It is used to measure directions to
some distant point like another ship or an object on land. It gives the
bearing relative to the ship’s heading or, if set to the ship’s true
course, the true bearing to the object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <i>Radio direction finder.</i> Located on the navigating bridge is the
ship’s radio direction finder. This instrument receives radio signals
and establishes the bearing of the sending station. It consists
essentially of a loop antenna for receiving the signals connected to a
radio receiver that makes the signals audible. The position of the ship
may be determined from radio bearings by taking cross bearings on two
or more stations, by two bearings on the same station and the distance
run between bearings, and by a bearing and a sounding.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Fathometer.</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A fathometer is installed on the navigating bridge to determine
the depth of water under the ship. This instrument works on the echo
depth-finding process. Briefly, it consists of a submarine oscillator
in the bottom of the ship that produces a sound of sufficient intensity
to travel to the ocean floor and reflect back to a sensitive receiver
also located in the ship’s bottom. The difference between the time of
sending the sound and receiving the echo is measured by the fathometer,
translated into depth, and flashed on the dial as a red light opposite
a numeral corresponding to the depth in fathoms.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Near the fathometer is a fathometer recorder that records on
a paper chart the depths indicated by the fathometer. This gives a
continuous depth profile of the ocean bottom along the ship’s course.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Chartroom equipment.</i> In the chartroom are sextants, protractors,
dividers, parallel rules, chronometer, hydrographic charts, and a chart
table.</p>

<p><b>c. Communications.</b></p>

<p>(1) <i>Radio.</i> The radio equipment consists of a main receiver and
transmitter with emergency sets and a short-wave receiver and
transmitter. The radio sets presently used are shown in figures 9 and
11. The manuals describing this equipment are listed in ASF Catalog Sig
10-1.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Radio telephone.</i> Radio telephone communication is handled
by the short-wave transmitter and receiver. (See fig. <a href="#fig_11_bot">11</a>.) They
operate on frequencies between 2 and 3 million cycles per second with
separate channels designated for specific purposes. For ship-to-shore
communication, frequencies range between 2,100 and 2,200 kilocycles.
Direct ship-to-ship communication is on 2,738 kilocycles. The sets thus
send and receive on different frequencies.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Visual signal equipment.</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Flashing light signals.</i> Flashing light signals are made with a
dot-and-dash blinker light. The light is on top of the pilot house for
greater visibility and is mounted so it can be shone in any direction.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Flag signaling.</i> The ship carries complete sets of International
flags and pennants and hand flags for signaling by semaphore.</p>

<p><b>d. Main engine.</b></p>

<p>(1) The main engine is an 8-cylinder, supercharged 4-cycle Diesel
capable of developing 1,300 hp. (See fig. <a href="#fig_12">12</a>.)</p>

<p>(2) The engine has an air starting system; pressure lubrication for all
running parts except the pistons, which are lubricated by oil thrown
into the cylinder walls by the cranks; and an indirect cooling system
in which clean soft water is circulated in a closed circuit and cooled
by sea water in the heat exchangers. The fuel system uses a manifold
in which fuel is maintained at constant pressure but in which there is
no pressure on the injection valves except during the actual time of
injection.</p>

<p><b>e. Auxiliary engines.</b> Diesel and gasoline auxiliary engines
furnish power for the ship’s generators, compressors, and pumps.
Typical of the auxiliary engine installations are the 120-hp Diesels
used to drive the fire pumps. (See fig. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>.)</p>

<p><b>f. Electrical systems and generators.</b> Electricity for the
ship’s lighting system and for the electrically operated equipment are
furnished by Diesel or gasoline-driven generators. In case the main
generator fails, an emergency generator starts automatically. If all
generators should fail, batteries supply the power. (See fig. <a href="#fig_14">14</a>.)</p>

<p><b>g. Lifeboats.</b> The ship carries two 26-foot power whaleboats,
two oar-propelled lifeboats, life rafts, and a number of small rubber
floats. (See figs. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>, <a href="#fig_15">15</a> and <a href="#fig_16">16</a>.)</p>

<p>The two life rafts (figs. <a href="#fig_1">1</a> and <a href="#fig_16">16</a>) are mounted on skids at an angle of
about 45&deg;. Each skid has a releasing device that permits quick release
of the raft into the water or will let it float free if the ship sinks.</p>

<p><b>h. Mooring and towing.</b></p>

<p>(1) Installed on the main deck at the ship’s stern is a combination
towing machine and anchor windlass. It hoists and lowers the two
3,000-pound Danforth anchors.</p>

<p>When used for towing, it carries the towline on a reel and pays it out
and hauls it in automatically to keep towing tension constant.</p>

<p>(2) For handling the two bow anchors, a windlass is installed on the
forecastle deck. (See fig. <a href="#fig_17">17</a>.)</p>

<b>a. General.</b> Enemy destruction of a port’s facilities generally
may be divided into two classifications.</h3>

<p>(1) <i>Channels and harbors.</i> Offshore obstructions in the waters of
the harbor include booms and torpedo nets, debris, prepared sunken
obstacles, destruction of navigation aids and moorings, and damage to
underwater pilings and foundations. It is the engineer port repair
ship’s job to remove or destroy these obstacles and to make the
underwater repairs.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Damage to shore installations.</i> The destruction of shore
installations includes damage to utilities, shops, warehouses, railway
spurs and yards, roads, bridges, locked basins, cargo-handling
equipment, piers, wharves, and quays. It is the mission of the port
construction and repair groups to repair and put these facilities back
in operation.</p>

<p><b>b. Enemy damage to captured ports.</b> Although the conditions
outlined below will not hold true in all cases, they were found in
captured ports.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Warehouses and shops.</i> All warehouses and shops were destroyed by
demolition and fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <i>Utilities.</i> Electric, water, gas, and communications systems were
put out of commission by demolition and removal of parts.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Locked basins and docks.</i> All locked basins and closures were
destroyed; walls of basins were collapsed by explosives.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Wharves and quays.</i> Demolitions destroyed the inshore 100 feet of
quay full width to a depth of 30 feet. Mines destroyed all cranes and
blew out the face of the quay in sections about 40 feet long, 30 feet
back, and 20 feet deep. Cranes usually are spaced about 75 feet apart.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Miscellaneous.</i> Delayed-action mines and booby traps were placed
at strategic places, even in sunken boats and ships.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Channels and harbors.</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Ships were sunk to block entrances to harbors.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) All mooring buoys and channel markers were removed.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) All boats and lighters available to the enemy were sunk adjacent
to quays, wharves, and piers.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Wharf cranes and debris were blown into channels alongside
wharves and quays. (See figs. <a href="#fig_49">49</a> through <a href="#fig_53">53</a>.)</p>

restoration of the port’s facilities. He orders surveys made of the
extent and nature of the damage and from them determines what work is
to be done and who is to do it, sets priorities, and estimates time,
personnel, materials, and equipment required. Before actual repairs can
be started, the following preparatory work usually has to be done by
Army and Navy units:</h3>

<p>(9) Install navigation aids and moorings.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Following are some of the jobs the port repair ship might be
required to do:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Install navigation aids in entrance channel.</i> After the harbor
area has been swept of mines by the Navy, the port repair ship marks
the entrance channel with buoys. This is done by soundings and by using
hydrographic charts of the harbor. Soundings are made by the ship’s
fathometer, by lead lines, and by a portable depth finder. The portable
depth finder works on the same principle as the ship’s fathometer
(par. 8) and is installed on one of the two powerboats. The powerboat
operates ahead of the port repair ship, takes continual soundings,
and marks the boundaries of the channel. The crew of the powerboat is
constantly on the alert for underwater obstructions and signals the
ship if any are found and whether the ship must change her course or
stop.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Blockships.</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A blockship is a prepared underwater obstacle sunk to prevent
ships from following navigable channels. One or more blockships may be
found in an entrance channel. These ships are often filled with rock or
concrete to make them more difficult to remove.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When soundings, intelligence reports, or information received
from the minesweepers indicate the location of a blockship, a diver is
sent down for reconnaissance. The information required to determine the
course of action is—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Position blockship is in. That is, is it on its side, at an angle,
or resting on its keel.</p>

<p>2. Approximate size and type of vessel.</p>

<p>3. Nature and extent of its superstructure.</p>

<p>4. Would the removal or destruction of the superstructure leave
enough water between the hull and the surface for large vessels to
use the channel?</p></div>

  <div class="blk_img vm_20" id="fig_53">
    <img
      class="i_p43"
      alt=""
      src="images/i_p43.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><i>Figure 53. Two half-sunken ships and the bomb crater
in harbor’s seawall and quay show the results of well-planned
destruction.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>5. Nature of bottom and effect of currents.</p>

<p>6. Is ship filled with rock or concrete?</p>

<p>7. Indications of mines and booby traps.</p></div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) This information determines whether the superstructure can be cut
through or flattened with explosives or if the hull has to be broken up
before the channel is cleared. Destroying the hull is a long, difficult
task and should not be attempted if the removal of the superstructure
affords enough clearance.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Harbor.</i></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>General.</i> When the port repair ship enters the harbor,
her master reports to the port commander for instructions. These
instructions include—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. What jobs the ship is to do and what priorities have been set on
them.</p>

<p>2. What materials, equipment, power, tools, and personnel the ship is
to furnish the port construction and repair group.</p>

<p>3. Whether temporary construction or repairs are to be made or
permanent repairs made.</p>

<p>4. Surveys to be made of underwater damage and obstructions in harbor
area.</p></div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Removal of small sunken craft and debris.</i> Small boats usually
are sunk alongside wharves and quays to prevent ships from approaching
close enough to unload. Also, cranes and sections of the wharves blown
into the water have to be removed. Divers examine the debris and
determine whether it can be pulled out of the way into deeper water
or if it first must be broken up. Since the use of large quantities
of explosives may further damage adjacent quays and piers, debris too
heavy and bulky to hoist and drag is cut into smaller sections by
underwater cutting. Then these sections are raised by the cathead and
pulled out of the way by the ship. Small, sunken craft often can be
salvaged by sealing up the hulls and pumping out the water with salvage
pumps. This type of salvage work can be done from the 50-ton barge
which leaves the repair ship free for other jobs.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Furnishing materials, power, and equipment.</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>1. Materials.</i> Materials required by the port group to start its
work can be furnished in limited quantities by the repair ship.
However until cargo ships can unload at the port, the group must
get locally the bulk of the materials it needs. The small amount of
cement, timbers, and structural steel that the ship carries can be
put ashore on the ship’s barge.</p>

<p><i>2. Power.</i> Until local sources of power are restored or floating
power plants are available, power for lighting and for operating
equipment is supplied by the ship’s stationary and portable
generators and compressors.</p>

<p><i>3. Equipment.</i> Such portable equipment as the clamshell bucket,
welding and cutting outfits, trailer-mounted fire pumper, and
pneumatic tools, is turned over to the group as it is needed.
If necessary, equipment operators are furnished from the ship’s
personnel.</p></div>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Use of the ship’s shops.</i> The ship’s shops are used to make
parts for and to repair port machinery and equipment. Typical jobs are
to repair engines and motors and to construct or repair cargo-handling
equipment.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Underwater construction and repairs.</i> The ship’s divers may
be required to repair the underwater structures of damaged piers and
quays. Broken or weakened pilings or timbers may have to be cut and
removed so new ones can be placed. Also, the foundations of harbor
breakwaters or sea walls may require strengthening or repairs.</p>

<p><b>c. Safety of ship.</b> While operating in the close waters of the
harbor, especially while threatened with the additional hazards of
debris, mines, underwater obstacles, and enemy air attack, the safety
of the ship is of paramount importance. The master of the ship is
responsible for her safety. He sees that the gun crews are at their
stations and that enough deckhands are available for the extra work
required in mooring and maneuvering.</p>

<p><b>d. Summary.</b> Speed is essential in port repair work to eliminate
the necessity of landing troops, stores, and equipment over beaches for
any length of time. The engineer port repair ship has an important part
in getting this work started by opening the harbor to navigation and
by furnishing power, equipment, and supplies to the port construction
and repair groups. The shops on the ship help prevent stoppages caused
by breakdown of machinery and equipment because they can repair or
manufacture essential parts that may be needed. In short, the port
repair ship is the spearhead in getting port reconstruction work under
way and, by its ability to do many different tasks, helps to speed up
this work and keep it going.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
